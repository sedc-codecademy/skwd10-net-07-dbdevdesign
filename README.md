# Welcome to Database Development and Design ðŸš€

This course is a unique one, as it's the only course that focuses specifically on data storage and developing data management solutions. Database and data storage plays a key role in future classes and in any software developer role in general, since we almost always work with some kind of data for our apps and solutions. The course will cover the basics in Databases as well as how to manipulate them with the programming language SQL. Hope you have fun and good luck ðŸ˜‰
